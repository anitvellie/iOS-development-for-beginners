# iOS-development-for-beginners
iOS dev courses for beginners in OLIMP (ITMO University)

## What's that?
It's a beginner level course in iOS development (Swift), made by me, mostly for me and for people who are willing to start learning Swift with me at my university.

## Why?
I decided to create this course to upgrade myself in Swift by teaching other people how to Swift.
